Issue tracking isn't just another software‚Äîit's a critical category in B2B solutions. However, existing tools often fall short. They either become bloated by trying to cater to every company's unique processes or are too simplistic, failing to handle complex use cases effectively.

Current issue tracking tools function primarily as systems of record, lacking the deeper integration of context and actions that truly drive productivity.

At Tegon, our goal is to build an issue tracking tool that serves as a system of record, context, and action. Beyond just tracking progress, Tegon will provide full context on ongoing work through seamless integration with other tools, and act as a system of actions to elevate organizational productivity.
